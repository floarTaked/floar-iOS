Scrollable UINavigationBar that follows the scrolling of a UIScrollView or similar view (e.g. UITableView or UIWebView). 
It works like the navigation bar in Chrome or Facebook's app for iOS7.  

I also wrote about this control in [this article](http://andreamazz.github.io/blog/2014/02/01/amscrollingnavbar-creating-a-cocoapod/)

Getting Started
=================

Setup
--------------------
* Add ```pod 'AMScrollingNavbar'``` to your [Podfile](http://cocoapods.org/)
* Run ```pod install```
* Run ```open App.xcworkspace```
* Import ```UIViewController+ScrollingNavbar.h``` in your controller
* Implement the two following methods:
```objc
- (void)viewWillDisappear:(BOOL)animated
{
	[super viewWillDisappear:animated];
	[self showNavBarAnimated:NO];
}

```

Enable the scrolling
--------------------
To enable the scrolling effect you simply need to call followScrollView: providing the UIView's instance that will be tracked, like this:
```objc
[self followScrollView:self.scrollView];
```
You can also set a delay (in points) for the gesture that reveals the navigation bar.
```objc
[self followScrollView:self.scrollView withDelay:60];
```

Make sure to have a ```barTintColor``` for your ```UINavigationBar```, or you won't see the fade-in and fade-out effects.
Also make sure that you are not using a translucent navigation bar. E.g., in your controller:
```objc
[self.navigationController.navigationBar setTranslucent:NO];
```

Set the view constraints
--------------------
Make sure to set your scrollview's constraint properly. Please note that the library changes the scrollview's superview frame.
